# Sorting imports

Consistent import ordering improves navigation and reduces merge conflicts. When imports follow a common structure, it is easier to find dependencies and understand module boundaries.

```tsx
import { Button } from './Button';
import React from 'react';
import styles from './Button.module.css';
import clsx from 'clsx';
import { ReactNode, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
```

```tsx
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

import clsx from 'clsx';

import { Button } from './Button';

import styles from './Button.module.css';
```

Automating routine tasks lets the team focus on more important work. Tools and plugins can sort imports on save or during builds. A common practice is to group imports by origin (framework, third-party, local) and separate groups with blank lines for readability.
